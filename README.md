# Bluesky Guide
Collection of Tips &amp; Tools for collaborating on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) shared by [Jeftek.com](https://bsky.app/profile/jeftek.com)

**Shortlink:** [https://teklink.io/BlueskyGuide](https://teklink.io/BlueskyGuide) - Easier to share!

# Tips
## Account Security
- **Use a Unique Long Password** -  Be sure to use a unique and long password such as a pass phrase for your account.
  * Think "My Dog has 2 Black Spots On their tail" is better than "BlueWinter24!"
- **Enable MFA for login** -  Currently Bluesky only offers email (You do require MFA on your email right?) based secondary verification when signining in with your main password, which can be enabled in your account settings.  (I hope to see Passkey support once they enable OAUTH.)
  * Settings > Two-factor authentication >  Enable Require email code to log into your account
- **Use Unique App Passwords for 3rd party apps** - When signing into 3rd party apps and services, you can generate an App Password for a specific app.
  * Settings > Advanced > App Passwords
## Custom Domains
Bluesky allows you to set your owned custom domain name as your handle/username, and is a great way to demonstrate your account is associated with your public web presence.

- [Purchase Domain for Bluesky account](https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap) - If you don't already own your own domain, you can purchase one straight through Bluesky and Namecheap
## Content Discovery
When you first join, and are not following people Bluesky can be a lonely space.   Luckily there are plenty of tools and services for discovering accounts and content to follow to get engaged.

## Safety
### Posts on Bluesky Safety

### Starter Packs
One of the best feastures they added were Starter Packs, which are curated collections of accounts you can review to follow or follow them all at once. You can find these all over Bluesky, but take a look at a persons profile under "Starter Packs" and see if they have published one of their own you can follow on a topic.
- You can see the starter packs I publish on my profile here [Jeftek.com/](https://bsky.app/profile/jeftek.com)

### Custom Feeds
You see content based on who you follow, but you also can subscribe to custom feeds that people create on a whole variety of topics.   You can then choose to pin these to your home feed and switch between them like channels.  This allows you to choose not to follow accounts, but subscribe to feeds which may include those accounts so you can switch your viewing almost like channels.
Like Starter Packs, people can choose to create custom feeds they publish on their Bluesky profile, so if you find someone interesting you follow check out their profile and see if they are publishing any.  
- You can see the custom feeds I publish on my profile here [Jeftek.com/](https://bsky.app/profile/jeftek.com)

## Content Optimization
Your timeline is initially filled with who you follow, but you don't have to follow everyone to see their content.  You may choose to limit who follow, but instead add them to your personal lists that you can switch to to see posters in that lists topic.  You can easily pin lists to your home page and switch between them for different feeds or channels of related content. Combining this with public feeds, you can keep your main following optimized and have different channels to swap to from your main timeline view.  
- A good example is choosing not follow News sources, but instead add them to a custom list or follow a public feed that includes them so you only view the content when you switch to it.
